      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
       I'm a software engineer with a passion for building thoughtful, user-focused web and mobile applications. I enjoy working across the stack, from backend APIs to clean, intuitive UIs. Outside of coding, I'm into MMA and football, and I generally love trying new things and meeting new people. I'm always looking for new challenges and ideas that push me to grow.
